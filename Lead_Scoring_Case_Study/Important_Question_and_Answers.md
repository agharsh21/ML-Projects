So during this phase, they wish to make the lead conversion more aggressive. So they want almost all of the potential leads (i.e. the customers who have been predicted as 1 by the model) to be converted and hence, want to make phone calls to as much of such people as possible. Suggest a good strategy they should employ at this stage.

### 4. Similarly, at times, the company reaches its target for a quarter before the deadline. During this time, the company wants the sales team to focus on some new work as well. So during this time, the company’s aim is to not make phone calls unless it’s extremely necessary, i.e. they want to minimize the rate of useless phone calls. Suggest a strategy they should employ at this stage.


After reaching its quarterly target early, X Education should minimize unnecessary phone calls by 


   - Employing automated communication methods like email campaigns and chatbots. 
   - Refine lead scoring to prioritize only high-potential leads for follow-up. 
   - Focus the sales team on creating educational content, conducting webinars, and engaging in market research. 
   - Utilize CRM automation and data analysis to track lead interactions and improve nurturing processes. 
   - Shift the team's efforts to internal projects, process optimization, customer feedback analysis, and strategic planning. 


This approach maintains efficiency, ensures valuable lead engagement, and supports long-term business growth.
